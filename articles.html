            <h1>Tips for choosing a phone</h1>
            <p>Difficulty choosing the right phone? With the help of these
                tips, you can easily choose the phone that fit your needs.</p>
            <h4>The Display</h4>
            <p>If you're like most of us, you're going to spend hours each day staring at your smartphone screen.
                Make
                sure you're buying one that's bright enough to see in outdoors, and sharp enough where text doesn't
                look
                blurry while you're surfing the web. If you're buying a phone with a large screen, don't go under a
                resolution of 1920 x 1080 and, if you can splurge, look for the sharper 2560 x 1440 Quad HD
                resolutions.
                Consider the screen size, too. Can you easily reach across it? Do you want a larger screen for
                movies or
                a smaller one that's easier to hold and less likely to drop out of your hands?</p>
            <h4>The Battery</h4>
            <p>Read reviews or talk to people who already own the phone you're interested in buying. You want
                one that's
                going to last all day, if possible. The biggest complaint I hear from friends and family is that
                their
                smartphones are "always dead." If you're in this bunch, consider a smartphone with a fast
                charging
                battery. Most Android smartphone makers include the special chargers that can juice up a battery
                to at
                least a half charge in just minutes. Or if you own an iPhone, consider buying an iPad charger to
                get
                more juice.</p>

            <h4>The Storage</h4>
            <p>I know plenty of folks try to save money by buying cheaper phone but often they ship without
                much storage
                on board. I recommend buying smartphone with at least 64GB of storage, or more if you plan
                to download
                music and movies. Apps are much bigger these days, and pictures can take a lot of space on
                your device
                if you're not storing them in the cloud (Apple Photos, Google Photos, OneDrive etc...) Some
                Android
                smartphones also offer microSD card slots that lets you to boost the storage space by
                connecting a
                microSD.</p>

            <h4>The Operating System</h4>
            </hr>
            <p>Each Operating System has its own pros and cons. Therefore,
                it is very important to choose the right one to get the best experience. Look for the

                    <h2>Android</h2>
                    <p>Android is a mobile operating system primarily designed for
                        smartphones and tablets. It was originally developed by Android Inc and then the company was
                        acquired by
                        Google. It is free and open source, so that's why many phone manufacturers include it on thier
                        phones. About
                        76.23% of all phones in the world run on the Android operating system.</p>

                    <h4>Customization</h4>
                    <p>Android is very customizable. In Android, if you do
                        not like the look of the home screen you can install an additional launcher.</p>
                    <h4>File Management</h4>
                    <p>In Android, you have access to the entire file system. This
                        means you can save a file and access it from any app. Also, you can connect your phone to a PC
                        and
                        edit all
                        your files.</p>
                    <h4>Default Apps</h4>
                    <p>In Android, you can choose the default apps like browser or
                        music player.</p>
                    <h4>App download location</h4>
                    <p>In Android, you can actually install apps that are not
                        available from Play Store. This feature is disabled by default for security but you can enable
                        if
                        you want
                        but,
                        you should be careful and only install apps from a trusted location.</p>
                    <h4>More device options</h4>
                    <p>Android runs on lots of devices, so you have the option to
                        get
                        a phone that's right for you and that you can afford.</p>
                    <i><b><u>
                                <h3>Cons</h3>
                            </u></b></i>
                    <h4>Security</h4>
                    <p>While most of us don't get malware on our phones, remember
                        that you can. As Android let's you to download apps outside the Play Store, you can install an
                        app
                        that
                        could
                        be malware. Also, most Phone manufacturers makes a lot of customization in the version of
                        Android
                        that is
                        shipped
                        on their phones. That means you won't get updates immediately when it is released because your
                        manufacturer
                        needs
                        to
                        update thier version of Android. However many does not seem to care. This is why we still see
                        phones
                        still
                        running Android 6 even though Android
                        10 has been released.</p>
                    <h4>Bloatwares</h4>
                    <p>Most Android phones comes with unwanted apps preinstalled.
                        These apps slow down your phone by running in the background and they show you targeted ads.
                        Manufacturers do
                        this because they get money.</p>
                    <h4 style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif;">Accessibility</h4>
                    <p>Android does not have a lot of Accessibility features. This
                        makes Android hard to be used by a disabled person.</p>

                    <p>iOS has a built-in barcode scanner and QR code reader while on Android you'll install one.
                    <h4>Security</h4>
                    <p>iOS is more secure than Android OS when it come to
                        protecting your data because Google is a advertising company who don't respect your privacy.

                        iOS only runs on iPhones, so you get updates immediately when it's released.</p>
                    <h4>Perfomance</h4>
                    <p>iOS only runs on iPhones so it is optimized for it's
                        hardware and you get decent perfomance even on low end models.</p>

                    <h4 style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">Less device options</h4>
                    <p>iOS is exclusively availabe for the iPhone only, so if you
                        want phone that has iOS, you can only go for the iPhone (which is expensive and may not suit
                        your budget).
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">File Management</h4>
                    <p>In iOS, you can only view photos when you connect to a PC.
                        To view and edit a file, you can use
                        iTunes on Windows and earlier versions of macOS or Finder on macOS Catalina.</p>

                    <p>In iOS, you can only install apps from
                        the App Store. To sideload apps on an iPhone, you need to jailbreak your iPhone which might
                        be
                        illegal
                        based on you
                        region.</p>
                    <h4 style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif;">No SD Card Support</h4>
                    <p>No iPhones till this date support SD Cards. This means you
                        can only use the built-in storage and can't extent it.</p>
                    <h4 style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif;">Language support</h4>
                    <p>iOS supports fewer languages than Android, which makes it
                        not friendly for everyone.</p>
